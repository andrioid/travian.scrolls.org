===================

Retired project. I got a bit overly engaged in an online game called Travian.

I uploaded this to Github for two reasons:

- I wanted to keep a copy online for myself
- People still play Travian, so if they can use any of my obsessive gaming tools, fine.

# Project List

- "/": Relative Distance Calculator. Insert coordinates and it will tell you how far you are from your neighbor. I used it mostly to find people to farm.
- "/maps": Self explainatory. Was playing with Canvas and public data from game servers
- "wm": War Machine. Probably the craziest project of them all. Given coordinates of allies... this little tool created attack schedules that would force the opposing teams to defend their towns during night-time. You would get 100 incoming attacks from all over the map and they would all hit you at the same exact time. Tool also creates messages to send to allies.

There is probably a bunch of crap in there... and I made this stuff while studying, so... if anyone can use this, fine. If not... that's fine too :)
