<strong>Hi!</strong><br>
<br><i>
Thank you for your interest in my Travian tools. However for some strange, but evil reason your IP address appears to be on my blocklist.</i><br>
<br>
<strong>This could be for the following reasons</strong>
<ul>
<li>You're playing on my server and you are attacking my alliance (HH on dk_s5)</li>
<li>You like hurting bunnies</li>
<li>You eat bunnies</li>
<li>You don't like bunnies</li>
</div><br style="clear: both;">
<div id="note" style="width: 500px">

<span style="font-size: 9px; font-weight: bold;">Evil Bunny also thinks you should stop hurting those poor Hellhounds</span>
